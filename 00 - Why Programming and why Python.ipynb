    "We want to be able to recreate some one else scientific work on our own data, and be able to share our methods, by developing routines that are repeatabile this process is much easier. Developing modular codes allows for processes that are the same for different tasks to be redone without having to rewrite code\n",

    "> I want take in a catalog of earthquakes, pull out only the events within oil fields, return the surface wave magnitude of the events, and plot them on a map based on size.

I write a function that accurately picks out the arrival time for a single event. I then call this function 1000000 times in a script in order to pick all events. \n",

What we need is to have a language that can be learned quickly, but at the same time is powerful enough to satisfy our needs. Complete workflows are simple to develop."
