##Installing git:

Go to [GIT] (http://git-scm.com/downloads) and pick the right download for your operating system, follow their instructions

##Creating a github account: 

[Join Github] (https://github.com/join)

##Getting python going: 

We recommend using [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) for easy installation of all the python dependencies. 
Canopy provides a easy to use interface, most of the basic packages, a package manager, is
free with a academic license, and is cross platform. Most of the needed dependendicies should be available in the free version of the software.

Other options for installing Python are:

* [spyder] (https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/)
* [anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)
* [Other options] (https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDistributions)

Or alternatively you can install from your favorite package manager if you are using linux e.g.:


  `sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib` <---ubuntu flavors
 
or use [YaST] (https://en.opensuse.org/YaST_Software_Management) <----open suse
