Getting python going: 

We recommend using [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) for easy installation of all the python dependencies. 
Canopy provides a easy to use interface, most of the basic packages, a package manager, and is
free with a academic license. Most of the dependendicies should be availble in the free version of the software.

Other options for installing Python are:

* [spyder] (https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/)
* [anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)

Or alternatively you can install from your favorite package manager if you are using linux e.g.:
  sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib <---ubuntu flavors
  yum install ? <----open suse
