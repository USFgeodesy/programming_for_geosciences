 
What do I need?
=======================================

* a computer 
* github account 
* python
* ipython
* matplotlib
* numpy 
* pandas
* jupyter notebook 

How do I get it?
=======================================

##Installing git:

Go to [GIT] (http://git-scm.com/downloads) and pick the right download for your operating system, follow their instructions

##Creating a github account: 

[Join Github] (https://github.com/join)

##Getting python going: 

We recommend using  [anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) for easy installation of all the python dependencies. 
Anaconda provides a easy to use IDE through spyder, most of the basic packages, a package manager in conda, is
free with a academic license, and is cross platform. Most of the needed dependendicies should be available in the free version of the software.

If installing anaconda is difficult, or you are worried about messing up other installations on your machine, another option is [Wakira](https://www.
wakira.io) . Wakaria runs an anaconda python enviornment in the cloud, along with a nice text editor and shell. It is essentially working computer
in the cloud! We will post our assignment bundles on wakaria in order to follow the notebooks with all needed data.

Other options for installing Python and needed packages are:

* [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/)
* [Other options] (https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDistributions)

Or alternatively you can install from your favorite package manager if you are using linux e.g.:


  `sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib` <---ubuntu flavors
 
or use [YaST] (https://en.opensuse.org/YaST_Software_Management) <----open suse

Running the notes:
=====================================

1. create a working directory

  `mkdir geopug`
  `cd geopug` 
  
2. get the project from github

  `git clone .git`


3. start notebook enviornemnt

  `ipython notebook`

4. click on the chapter you are interested in, should be completely interactive.
