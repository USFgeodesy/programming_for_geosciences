Programming for Geosciences
======================
This is a course adapted from [Python for Geosciences](https://github.com/koldunovn/python_for_geosciences), and borrowing heavily from previous USF GEOPUG courses, in order to make it a better suited for introductory scientific programming. 
We hope to use python to build familiarity with the process and capabilities of computer programming, and highlight the usefullness of python for geosciences research. 

Participants should see Before_we_Begin.md in order to aquire class software dependencies and an explanation of how to get the course materials on your machine. 

We will cover:

* ways to run python 
* Data Types 
* For,If, While 
* Writing a simple function
* Programming in style 
* Basic Operations and Math
* Input/Output (binary, txt, netCDF, mat).
* Creation of maps and graphs (Visualization).
* Some Time series analysis.
* Integration of other software within python (eg. gmt, perl, matlab) 
* Anything you want, feel free to suggest a a topic by opening a new issue of the github page, or if you are feeling ambitious contribute a lesson. 

* git and github will be used to distribute and collaborate through out this course

This overview is aimed at the graduate students who are interested in programming but don't know how to start using it, or those who would like to learn more about possible Python applications in geoscience. For those of you who already use Python there will be nothing really new however participation in encouraged.

The goal is to host a GEOPUG Hackathon and the end of the semester where all participants contribute in an open source project, managed through git, that solves some general goescientist need. This would be a great opportunity for those familiar with scientific programming to join in and learn more about software development... We will learn together!

For those only interested in Python, with basic knowlege of other languages such as matlab see Nikolaty Koldubnov's page at [earthpy.org](http://earthpy.org/category/introduction-to-python.html).

PRs with corrections are very welcomed.
